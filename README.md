# About
This is the Chaos Indivisvm Handbook repo. We will be moving the handbook to the website after it is complete. The handbook will be based on the work done for the [Void Linux Docs](https://github.com/void-linux/void-docs)


## TODO

1. Structure Repository
2. Convert and Style Existing Documentation
3. Style the Webpage
4. Move to the Webserver
