# Preface:
Anything labeled with "TBA" I need to consult with Dread to get hard numbers on. 
Most likely this will pertain to reload times, vehicle speeds, RPM for RC weaponry, and radii for explosions. 
RPM for physical weapons is also SLIGHTLY varied due to control events. 
Sometimes you'll be firing faster or slower than intended while full-autoing a weapon for reasons beyond your control.
